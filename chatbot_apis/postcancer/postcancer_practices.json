The American Cancer Society and the American Institute for Cancer Research have developed similar diet and fitness guidelines that may help reduce the risk of cancer: Eat a plant-based diet and have at least 5–9 servings of fruit and vegetables daily. Try to include beans in your diet, and eat whole grains (such as cereals, breads, and pasta) several times daily. Choose foods low in fat and low in salt. Get to and stay at a healthy weight. For more tips on nutrition and healthy eating, go to www.aicr.organd click on “Cancer Survivors,” or go to www.cancer.org and click on “nutrition.”"
