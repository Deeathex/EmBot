joy|On days when I feel close to my partner and other friends. When I feel at peace with myself and also experience a close contact with people whom I regard greatly.
fear|Every time I imagine that someone I love or I could contact a serious illness, even death.
anger|When I had been obviously unjustly treated and had no possibility of elucidating this.
sadness|When I think about the short time that we live and relate it to the periods of my life when I think that I did not use this short time.
disgust|At a gathering I found myself involuntarily sitting next to two people who expressed opinions that I considered very low and discriminating.
shame|When I realized that I was directing the feelings of discontent with myself at my partner and this way was trying to put the blame on him instead of sorting out my own feeliings.
guilt|I feel guilty when when I realize that I consider material things more important than caring for my relatives. I feel very self-centered.
joy|After my girlfriend had taken her exam we went to her parent's place.
fear|When, for the first time I realized the meaning of death.
anger|When a car is overtaking another and I am forced to drive off the road.
sadness|When I recently thought about the hard work it takes to study, and how one wants to try something else. When I read a theoretical book in English that I did not understand.
disgust|When I found a bristle in the liver paste tube.
shame|When I was tired and unmotivated, I shouted at my girlfriend and and brought up negative sides of her character which are actually not so important.
guilt|When I think that I do not study enough. After the weekend I think that I should have been able to have accomplished something during that time.
